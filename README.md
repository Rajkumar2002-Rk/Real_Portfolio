## 🧑‍💻 About Me

I'm an AI and Machine Learning Engineer building **production-grade AI systems**, **Generative AI pipelines**, and **scalable data infrastructure** on AWS. My work spans the full AI stack — from RAG chatbots and vector databases to cloud-native ML pipelines and automated MLOps workflows.

- 🤖 I build **Generative AI systems**: RAG pipelines, LangChain, vector databases, prompt engineering, OpenAI API integration
- 🔭 I build **end-to-end ML pipelines**: data ingestion → feature engineering → model training → real-time inference → automated monitoring
- ☁️ I design **cloud-native data systems** using AWS S3, Lambda, Kinesis, SageMaker, RDS, and EventBridge
- 🧠 I apply **ML across domains**: fraud detection, churn prediction, demand forecasting, and computer vision
- 📊 I implement **MLOps practices**: data drift detection, automated retraining, CloudWatch monitoring, SageMaker managed training jobs
- 🎓 AWS Certified Cloud Practitioner · MS CS, Pace University, New York

> *"Good AI engineering is building systems that are accurate, reliable, and grounded in real data."*

## 📊 Featured Projects

### 🟣 Enterprise RAG Chatbot ⭐ Latest
> *Production-ready Retrieval-Augmented Generation chatbot with source citations*

Built a full RAG pipeline that answers questions from custom PDF documents accurately — with zero hallucinations on out-of-scope queries. The system converts documents into 195 semantic chunks, stores them as vector embeddings in ChromaDB, and retrieves the top-3 most relevant chunks using cosine similarity search to ground every GPT response in real document content.

**Stack:** `Python` `LangChain` `OpenAI API` `ChromaDB` `Streamlit` `PyPDF`
**Architecture:** PDF → PyPDF → Chunking (500/50) → OpenAI Embeddings → ChromaDB → Cosine Search → GPT-3.5-turbo → Cited Answer
**Key Results:** 195 chunks indexed · Multi-document querying · Zero hallucinations on out-of-scope questions · Page-level source citations

### 🔴 Insurance Fraud Detection System
> *Cloud-native, real-time fraud detection pipeline on AWS*

Built a distributed 4-stage fraud detection pipeline that processes insurance claims from ingestion to inference. Achieved approximately 90% classification accuracy on 15K+ records using XGBoost with engineered features.

**Stack:** `Python` `XGBoost` `Scikit-learn` `AWS S3` `Lambda` `Kinesis` `RDS` `SageMaker`
**Architecture:** S3 Data Lake → Lambda ETL → Kinesis Stream → SageMaker Inference → RDS Reporting

### 🔵 Customer Churn Prediction — MLOps Pipeline
> *End-to-end MLOps pipeline with NLP feature extraction and automated retraining*

Built an MLOps pipeline predicting SaaS customer churn using NLP-extracted features from 7K+ support tickets. Integrated CloudWatch + EventBridge for automated model retraining on data drift. Achieved 0.67 recall on the minority class.

**Stack:** `Python` `XGBoost` `AWS S3` `Lambda` `SageMaker` `Comprehend` `CloudWatch` `EventBridge`
**Architecture:** S3 → Lambda ETL → Comprehend NLP → SageMaker Training → CloudWatch + EventBridge Auto-Retrain

---

### 🟢 Retail Sales Forecasting on AWS
> *Scalable batch ETL pipeline for time-series demand forecasting*

Engineered a batch ETL pipeline processing 500K+ retail transactions with temporal feature extraction and lag-based predictors. Deployed as a SageMaker real-time inference endpoint serving live predictions.

**Stack:** `Python` `XGBoost` `Pandas` `NumPy` `AWS S3` `SageMaker`
**Architecture:** Raw Transactions → Python ETL → S3 Data Lake → SageMaker Job → Real-Time Endpoint

---

### 🟠 Crypto Price Forecasting — Flask REST API
> *Multi-model ML system with live web dashboard*

Benchmarked LSTM, CNN, and XGBoost on 7-day Bitcoin price forecasting. XGBoost achieved the best generalization on held-out test data (lowest MAE and RMSE). Deployed as a Flask REST API with a live web dashboard providing sub-second response latency.

**Stack:** `Python` `XGBoost` `TensorFlow` `LSTM` `CNN` `Flask` `REST API`
**Deployment:** Persistent REST endpoint with live dashboard

---

### 🟣 3D Face Generation with Neural Radiance Fields
> *Deformable NeRF for photorealistic 3D face reconstruction*

Implemented Deformable NeRF for photorealistic 3D face reconstruction from monocular video. Applied multi-stage preprocessing for camera pose estimation using COLMAP. Reduced GPU memory consumption by over 30% through optimized batch rendering and selective ray sampling. Evaluated with PSNR across multiple synthesized viewpoints.

**Stack:** `Python` `JAX` `TensorFlow` `OpenCV` `COLMAP` `NeRF`
**Result:** 30%+ GPU memory reduction · PSNR-evaluated multi-view synthesis
